## cosa sono questi parametri?

**PFACTs (Panel Factorization Type)**

This parameter specifies the method used for the panel factorization during the LU decomposition. The options are:

0 = Left-looking factorization

1 = Crout factorization

2 = Right-looking factorization

It determines the approach used to compute the LU factorization of the matrix.

**NBMINs (Minimum Block Size)**

This defines the minimum block size for the matrix block. Itâ€™s the threshold size below which the blocks will be treated as scalar (i.e., no further blocking). Typically, this value is set to 1 or 2, and it impacts the granularity of the factorization process.

**BCASTs (Broadcasting Algorithm)**

This controls the method used to broadcast data between processes during the computation. The possible values are:

0 = 1-rank broadcast (used for certain one-dimensional process grids)

1 = 1-row broadcast

2 = 2-rank broadcast

3 = 2-row broadcast

4 = Long broadcast (used in specific scenarios with large data)

5 = Long multi-row broadcast

This parameter determines how data is shared across different processes in the parallel execution.

**RFACTs (Recursive Factorization Type)**

This controls the type of recursive factorization to be used. The options are:

0 = Left-looking recursive factorization

1 = Crout recursive factorization

2 = Right-looking recursive factorization

This parameter affects the strategy for handling recursive subproblems during the factorization process.

**SWAP (Swapping Method)**

This controls the type of data swapping method used for pivoting during the factorization:

0 = Binary exchange (used in a simpler, less costly method)

1 = Long exchange (a more complex method, potentially more expensive)

2 = Mixed (combines different swapping methods)

The SWAP parameter determines how the matrix rows and columns are exchanged during the LU factorization to ensure numerical stability.
